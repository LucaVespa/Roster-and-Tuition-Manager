This project is a simple roster/tuition manager that would be used by an administrative member. For an in-depth explanation be sure to check the video linked above.  
The program was originally written to work in the command line with no proper GUI. As such some of the design choices/code structure may seem a bit strange in the context of JavaFX since I built on top of what I had instead of starting over.
